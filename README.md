Sparks Foundation Internship Project 
Payment Gateway Integration

A Web Application used to donate money where payment gateway is integrated.. 
Languages used : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Javascript

There is a simple donate button on homepage. 
On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can
select the amount to donate

I have used Razorpay as 3rd party.

Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be
sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the
amount.
